abstract = {This chapter discusses the crystal momentum representation (CMR) that is evidently analogous to the momentum representation of ordinary continuum mechanics. It describes the Wannier representation’ (WR), which is analogous to the coordinate representation. The chapter discusses the development of the Crystal momentum representation (CMR) ab initio and relates the other methods to it. These include the Kohn–Luttinger or modified crystal momentum representation (MCMR) and the Wannier Representation (WR). Wannier was interested in the problem of the large exciton that is similar to but more difficult than the usual type of problem to be attacked by the methods. Wannier introduced Wannier functions to have localized states to describe the system and later derived an equation for the relative motion of the hole and electron, which is very similar to the equations discussed in the chapter.},

In this paper, we prove the conjecture. A key to this proof is that the real parts of complex Wannier functions equal to the algebraic average of two real Wannier functions and the spread functional of one of the two real Wannier functions is less than one of complex Wannier functions. If one starts with initial real Wannier functions, the gradients of spread functional to get the maximally localized Wannier functions are only calculated in half of Brillouin zone and more localized Wannier functions are obtained.},

An O(N) ground state calculation is carried out to get the density matrix (DM). Through a projection of the DM onto atomic orbitals and a subsequent O(N) orthogonalization, we obtain initial orthogonal localized orbitals. These orbitals can be maximally localized in linear scaling by simple Jacobi sweeps. Our O(N) method is validated by applying it to water molecule and wurtzite ZnO. The linear scaling behavior of the new method is demonstrated by computing the MLWFs of boron nitride nanotubes.},

The resulting functions were highly localized, with greater than 89{\%} of the norm of the function within the central site for the occupied Wannier states. Two methods for calculating Coulomb matrix elements from Wannier functions are presented and applied to fcc Cu. For the unscreened on-site Hubbard {\$}U{\$} for the Cu 3d-bands we have obtained about 25eV.

@book{Pavarini2012,
abstract = {Soon after the discovery of the basic principles of quantummechanics theorists set out to explain the properties of solids from a first-principles, atomistic perspective. However, it soon became clear that theoretical methods based on the calculation of fermionic many-particle wave functions are notoriously difficult to handle. A crucial step forward was density-functional theory (DFT) and its local-density approximation (LDA). The success of DFT in explaining the physical and chemical properties of solids is remarkable. Nevertheless, LDA and its generalizations fail for systems whose low-energy properties are dominated by electron-electron correlations, such as Mott-insulating transition-metal oxides, Kondo and heavy-fermion materials, organic crystals, and many others. The realistic description of these strongly correlated materials remains, to date, one of the grand challenges of condensed matter-physics. During the last few years conventional band-structure calculations in the local density approximation (LDA) have been merged with a modern many-body approach, the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), into a novel computational method referred to as LDA+DMFT. This framework has proved to be a breakthrough for the realistic modeling of the electronic, magnetic, and structural properties of materials such as transition metals and their oxides. Nevertheless the LDA+DMFT approach still needs to be considerably advanced to be able to treat increasingly complex systems. This requires, for example, an improvement of the interface between the band structure and many-body constituents of the approach, the refinement and integration of efficient impurity solvers, the realistic computation of free energies and forces, and the development of schemes to treat non-local correlations. For this purpose 25 researchers from 16 different institutions in the German-speaking part of Europe joined forces and established the Research Unit FOR 1346 on Dynamical Mean-Field Approach with Predictive Power for Strongly Correlated Materials, which is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft since July 2010. It is the goal of this Research Unit to develop the LDA+DMFT framework into a comprehensive ab initio approach which will be able to describe, and eventually even predict, the properties of complex correlated materials....},

@phdthesis{Trinckauf2013,
abstract = {In this thesis the charge dynamics of correlated electron systems, in which a metallic phase lies in close proximity to an ordered phase, are investigated by means of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The analysis of the experimental data is complemented by electronic structure calculations within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). First the charge dynamics of the colossal magnetoresistant bilayer manganites are studied. The analysis of the ARPES spectra based on DFT calculations and a Peierls type charge density wave model, suggests that charge, orbital, spin and lattice degrees of freedom conspire to form a fluctuating two dimensional local order that produces a large pseudo gap of about 450 meV in the ferromagnetic metallic phase and that reduces the expected bilayer splitting. Next, the interplay of Kondo physics and (magnetic) order in the heavy fermion superconductor URu2Si2 is investigated. The low energy electronic structure undergoes strong changes at 17.5 K, where a second order phase transition occurs whose phenomenology is well characterized, but whose order parameter could not yet be unambigeously identified. Below THO, non-dispersive quasi particles with a large scattering rate suddenly acquire dispersion and start to hybridize with the conduction band electrons. Simultaniously the scattering rate drops sinificantly and a large portion of the Fermi surface vanishes due to the opening of a gap within the band of heavy quasi particles. The observed behaviour is in stark contrast to conventional heavy fermion systems where the onset of hybridization between localized and itinerant carriers happens in a crossover type transition rather than abruptly. These experimental results suggest that Kondo screening and the hidden order parameter work together to produce the unusual thermodynamic signatures observed in this compound. Finally, the influence of charge doping and impurity scattering on the superconducting porperties of the transition metal substituted iron pnictide superconductor Ba(Fe1-xTMx)2As2 (TM = Co, Ni) is studied. Here, resonant soft X-ray ARPES is applied to see element selective the contribution of the 3d states of the TM substitute to the Fe 3d host bands. The spectroscopic signatures of the substitution are found to be well reproduced by DFT supercell and model impurity calculations. Namely, the hybridization of the dopant with the host decreases with increasing impurity potential and the electronic states of the impurtiy become increasingly localized. Simultaniously, in all simulated cases a shift of the Fermi level due to electron doping is observed. The magnitude of the shift in the chemical potential that accurs in BaFe2As2, however, is in stark contrast to the marginal doping values obtained for the impurity model, where the shift of the chemical potential is largely compensated by the influence of the increasing impurity potential. This suggests that the rigid band behaviour of TM substituded BaFe2As2 is a peculiarity of the compound, which has strong implications for the developement of superconductivity.},

abstract = {We have calculated the maximally-localized Wannier functions of MnO in its antiferromagnetic (AFM) rhombohedral unit cell, which contains two formula units. Electron Bloch functions are obtained with the linearized augmented plane-wave method within both the LSD and the LSD+U schemes. The thirteen uppermost occupied spin-up bands correspond in a pure ionic scheme to the five Mn 3d orbitals at the Mn{\_}1 (spin-up) site, and the four O 2s/2p orbitals at each of the O{\_}1 and O{\_}2 sites. Maximal localization identifies uniquely four Wannier functions for each O, which are trigonally-distorted sp{\^{}}3-like orbitals. They display a weak covalent bonding between O 2s/2p states and minority-spin d states of Mn{\_}2, which is absent in a fully ionic picture. This bonding is the fingerprint of the interaction responsible for the AFM ordering, and its strength depends on the one-electron scheme being used. The five Mn Wannier functions are centered on the Mn{\_}1 site, and are atomic orbitals modified by the crystal field. They are not uniquely defined by the criterion of maximal localization and we choose them as the linear combinations which diagonalize the r{\^{}}2 operator, so that they display the D{\_}3d symmetry of the Mn{\_}1 site.},

abstract = {We present wannier90, a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWF) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWF in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90 is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWF can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90 is able to output MLWF for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. wannier90 is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.org/.

Both available under open-source licenses. Nature of problem: Obtaining maximally-localised Wannier functions from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be entangled. Solution method: In the case of entangled bands, the optimally-connected subspace of interest is determined by minimising a functional which measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally-localised Wannier functions within this subspace are obtained by subsequent minimisation of a functional that represents the total spread of the Wannier functions in real space. For the case of isolated energy bands only the second step of the procedure is required. Unusual features: Simple and user-friendly input system. Wannier functions and interpolated band structure output in a variety of file formats for visualisation. Running time: Test cases take 1 minute. References:[1] N. Marzari, D.

abstract = {The electronic properties of graphene sheets are often understood by starting from a simple phenomenological $\pi$-band tight-binding model. We provide a perspective on these models that is based on a study of ab initio maximally localized Wannier wave functions centered at carbon sites. Hopping processes in graphene can be separated into intersublattice contributions responsible for band dispersion near the Dirac point, and intrasublattice contributions responsible for electron-hole symmetry breaking. Both types of corrections to the simplest near- neighbor model can be experimentally relevant. We find that distant neighbor hopping parameters increase the ratio of the full $\pi$-band width to the Dirac point velocity and flatten bands along the KM Brillouin-zone edge. We propose a five-parameter model which achieves a good compromise between simplicity and accuracy, and an alternate 15-parameter model achieves better accuracy with some loss of simplicity.},

abstract = {The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, but an alternative representation in terms of localized ''Wannier functions'' was introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937. The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or ''Boys orbitals'' as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices.},

abstract = {The treatment of molecules and crystals by the Heitler‐London method or by the collective electron model can be based on the atomic orbitals $\phi$$\mu$ of the system. These orbitals are in general overlapping, and the corresponding overlap integrals S $\mu$$\nu$, given by (1), have almost universally been neglected in the literature as causing undesirable complications. Here we will take these overlap integrals into consideration and show that they, instead of being negligible, are of essential importance in molecules and in crystals. The problem is simply solved by considering the orthonormalized functions [open phi]$\mu$, given by (21), as the real atomic orbitals. The solution is worked out in detail for (I) the molecular orbital method of treating molecules, (II) the Bloch orbital method of treating crystals, and (III) the Heitler‐London method of treating both these systems in some simple spin cases. Some numerical applications are given for ionic crystals, showing that the overlap effects are responsible for all the repulsive forces in these solids. It is also shown that the overlapping adds interesting new features to the properties of molecules and crystals, namely the ``many‐orbital‐effects,{\&}apos;{\&}apos; corresponding to certain ``many‐body‐forces{\&}apos;{\&}apos; in ionic solids.},

@article{Zurek2005,
abstract = {Herein, we outline a method that is able to generate truly minimal basis sets that accurately describe either a group of bands, a band, or even just the occupied part of a band. These basis sets are the so-called NMTOs, muffin-tin orbitals of order N. For an isolated set of bands, symmetrical orthonormalization of the NMTOs yields a set of Wannier functions that are atom-centered and localized by construction. They are not necessarily maximally localized, but may be transformed into those Wannier functions. For bands that overlap others, Wannier-like functions can be generated. It is shown that NMTOs give a chemical understanding of an extended system. In particular, orbitals for the pi and sigma bands in an insulator, boron nitride, and a semimetal, graphite, will be considered. In addition, we illustrate that it is possible to obtain Wannier-like functions for only the occupied states in a metallic system by generating NMTOs for cesium. Finally, we visualize the pressure-induced s-->d transition.},

First, we will discuss representative electromechanical and resistance-change memory devices based on carbon nanotube and core-shell nanowire structures, respectively. These device structures show robust switching, promising performance metrics and the potential for terabit-scale density. Second, we will review architectures being developed for circuit-level integration, hybrid crossbar/CMOS circuits and array-based systems, including experimental demonstrations of key concepts such lithography-independent, chemically coded stochastic demultipluxers. Finally, bottom-up fabrication approaches, including the opportunity for assembly of three-dimensional, vertically integrated multifunctional circuits, will be critically discussed.},

Three different top-down partitioning methods are investigated, and compared with formally more rigorous yet much more expensive bottom-up algorithms. We show that a conceptually simple top-down grid partitioning scheme achieves essentially the same efficiency as the more rigorous bottom-up approaches.},

abstract = {In order to discriminate between approximations to the exchange-correlation energy E XC [$\rho$ ↑ ,$\rho$ ↓ ], we employ the criterion of whether the functional is fitted to a certain experimental data set or if it is constructed to satisfy physical constraints. We present extensive test calculations for atoms and molecules, with the nonempirical local spin-density (LSD) and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and compare our results with results obtained with more empirical functionals. For the atomization energies of the G2 set, we find that the PBE functional shows systematic errors larger than those of commonly used empirical functionals. The PBE ionization potentials,electron affinities, and bond lengths are of accuracy similar to those obtained from empirical functionals. Furthermore, a recently proposed hybrid scheme using exact exchange together with PBE exchange and correlation is investigated. For all properties studied here, the PBE hybrid gives an accuracy comparable to the frequently used empirical B3LYP hybrid scheme. Physical principles underlying the PBE and PBE hybrid scheme are examined and the range of their validity is discussed.},

Whereas the debate about the stability of the corresponding bulk phase carbyne continues until today, the existence of isolated chains of carbon atoms has meanwhile been corroborated experimentally. Since graphene, as the two-dimensional sp(2)-bonded allotrope of carbon, has become a vast field, the question about the importance of one-dimensional carbon became of renewed interest. The present article gives an overview of the work that has been carried out on chains of carbon atoms in the past one or two decades. The review concentrates on isolated chains of carbon atoms and summarizes the experimental observations to date. While the experimental information is still very limited, many calculations of the physical and chemical properties have been published in the past years. Some of the most important theoretical studies and their importance in the present experimental situation are reviewed.},

This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

abstract = {The mechanical stabilities of planar (g) and low-buckled (b) honeycomb monolayer structures of silicon under various large strains are investigated using density functional theory (DFT). The mechanical properties, including the ultimate stresses, ultimate strains, and high order elastic constants of silicene are predicted, as well as the structure evolutions. Both g-Si and b-Si can sustain large strains (eta >= 0.15) for armchair, zigzag, and biaxial deformation. The third, fourth, and fifth order elastic constants are indispensable for accurate modeling of the mechanical properties under strains larger than 0.03, 0.06, and 0.08 respectively. The second order elastic constants, including in-plane stiffness, are predicted to monotonically increase with pressure while the Poisson ratio monotonically decreases with increasing pressure. Our results on the positive ultimate strengths and strains, second order elastic constants, and the in-plane Young's modulus indicate that both g-Si and b-Si are mechanically stable.},

abstract = {A power conversion efficiency record of 10.1{\%} was achieved for kesterite absorbers, using a Cu2ZnSn(Se,S)4 thin-film solar cell made by hydrazine-based solution processing. Key device characteristics were compiled, including light/dark J–V, quantum efficiency, temperature dependence of Voc and series resistance, photoluminescence, and capacitance spectroscopy, providing important insight into how the devices compare with high-performance Cu(In,Ga)Se2. The record kesterite device was shown to be primarily limited by interface recombination, minority carrier lifetime, and series resistance. The new level of device performance points to the significant promise of the kesterites as an emerging and commercially interesting thin-film technology. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The self-consistent electronic structures of Si, Ge, and zinc-blende GaP, GaAs, ZnS, and ZnSe have been determined using the linear combination of Gaussian orbitals method with a local-density form of the exchange-correlation functional. A completely general form of the spatial dependence of the potential has been used to describe accurately the bonding character in the tetrahedral environment. Results are presented for the valence- and conduction-band energies, densities of states, effective masses, and charge densities. Comparisons are made with previous calculations and with photoemission measurements. A striking result is that the local-density theory underestimates the optical band gaps by approximately 30\% or more, although the general conduction-band topology is good. The theoretical valence-band energies, charge densities, and electron and hole effective masses are also in good agreement with experiment. The energies and wave functions presented here are used to determine the optical properties of these materials in the following paper.},

abstract = {Low dimensionality offers a unique opportunity to introduce some relevant concepts of solid state physics, keeping the treatment at a simple level. This chapter begins with the presentation of the Bloch theorem for one-dimensional periodic lattices. A peculiar aspect of the energy spectrum of an electron in a periodic potential is the presence of allowed and forbidden energy regions. One-dimensional approaches are particularly suited to show from different points of view (weak binding, tight-binding, quantum tunneling, continued fractions) the mechanism of formation of energy bands in solids. The focus of this chapter is on one-dimensional periodic potentials, with traditional contributions going back to the early times of the foundation of quantum mechanics; brief digressions are given to evidence the conceptual link between this historical area of solid state and other much younger and very active areas of research such as artificial structures and superlattices, photonic crystals, atomic condensates.},
